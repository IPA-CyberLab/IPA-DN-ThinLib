All binary files on the 'hamcore' directory are free software under
the GPLv2 license. (Except WinPcap binaries.)

Some geeks should be interested in how to rebuild .sys (driver) files on
this directory. This text file helps such crazy geeks.


How to rebuild these '.sys' files?
----------------------------------

Windows Vista or later version of Windows requires all device drivers to be
signed by Authenticode digital certificate. Therefore, SoftEther VPN Project
publishes all necessary binary files in the 'hamcore' directory with
'already-signed' format by the certificate of SoftEther VPN Project.

That is the reason why the all .sys files (device drivers) are already built
and digitally signed by SoftEther VPN Project on the time of release of
the source code.

However, the entire source code of all the .sys files are contained on the
source code tree as follows:

- pxwfp_x86.sys and pxwfp_x64.sys
  You can build these files from the source code on the 'Wfp' directory.

- see.sys and see_x64.sys
  You can build these files from the source code on the 'See' directory.

- SeLow_x86.sys and SeLow_x64.sys
  You can build these files from the source code on the 'SeLow' directory.

- vpn_driver.sys, vpn_driver_x64.sys and vpn_driver_9x.sys
  You can build these files from the source code on the 'Neo' directory.

- vpn_driver6.sys and vpn_driver6_x64.sys
  You can build these files from the source code on the 'Neo6' directory.

It is recommended to build these files on the 'SEVPN.sln' Visual Studio 2008
solution file.

Note that rebuilding these files require Windows Driver Kits.
Loading the re-built .sys files requires your Authenticode certificate file
if the operating system is Windows Vista or later.



How to rebuild these 'vpn16.exe' files?
---------------------------------------

The vpn16.exe binary is the 16-bit Driver Install Utility for Windows 9x.
You can build this file from the 'vpn16' directory. However, you need
Visual C++ 16-bit edition and Windows 98 DDK to rebuild this 'vpn16.exe'.



How to rebuild the 'vpnweb.cab' and 'vpnweb.ocx' files?
-------------------------------------------------------
These files are ActiveX controls.
The source code is in the 'vpnweb' directory.


'winpcap_installer.exe' and 'winpcap_installer_win9x.exe'
---------------------------------------------------------
They are WinPcap binaries from http://www.winpcap.org/.
The WinPcap license is at http://www.winpcap.org/misc/copyright.htm page.
